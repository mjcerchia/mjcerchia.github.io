I am a fifth-year PhD student at Emory University working with <a href="https://dmzb.github.io/" target="_blank">David Zureick-Brown</a>.
I am broadly interested in algebraic geometry and number theory, with specific interests in the arithmetic of moduli spaces, stacks, and modular curves. As of Fall 2023, I am on the job market for a postdoctoral position.  

Here is my <A HREF="CV_MC81823.pdf">CV</A>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
I am not teaching in Fall 2023. In Fall 2021 and Spring 2022, I taught Math 111, Calculus 1. I have also been involved in the <a href="https://www.math.emory.edu/site/mathcircle/about.html#:~:text=Emory%20Math%20Circle%20is%20a,them%20a%20passion%20for%20mathematics." target="_blank">Emory Math Circle</a>, as an instructor for the High School A class in the 2019-2020 year, and as an assistant in later years. 

<h2>Papers and Projects </h2>
In Progress: <b>The canonical ring of the moduli space of abelian varieties for low genus</b>. <br>
In Progress: <b>The section ring of stacky genus 1 curves</b>, with Jesse Franklin and Evan O'Dorney <br>
In Progress: <b>Sporadic Quartic Torsion</b>, with Alexis Newton <br>

<b>Uniform bounds on the image of the arboreal Galois representations attached to non-CM elliptic curves</b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07468"> arxiv</a>, with Jeremy Rouse, <em>Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society</em>, 2021

<h2>Seminars</h2>
In Fall 2021 and Spring 2022, I organized a seminar on automorphic forms in preparation for the Arizona Winter School.
