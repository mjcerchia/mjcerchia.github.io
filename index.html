I am a fifth-year PhD student at Emory University working with <a href="https://dmzb.github.io/" target="_blank">David Zureick-Brown</a>. <br>
I am broadly interested in algebraic geometry and number theory, with specific interests in the arithmetic of moduli spaces, stacks, and modular curves. <br>
As of Fall 2023, I on on the job market for a postdoctoral position.  

My <a href="CV_101623.pdf"> CV.</a>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
I am not teaching in Fall 2023. In Fall 2021 and Spring 2022, I taught Math 111, Calculus 1. <br>
I have also been involved in the <a href="https://www.math.emory.edu/site/mathcircle/about.html#:~:text=Emory%20Math%20Circle%20is%20a,them%20a%20passion%20for%20mathematics." target="_blank">Emory Math Circle</a>, as an instructor for the High School A class in the 2019-2020 year, and as an assistant in later years.

<h2>Seminars</h2>
In Fall 2021 and Spring 2022, I organized a seminar on automorphic forms in preparation for the Arizona Winter School.

<h2>Other</h2>
In Summer 2023, I was an intern at MinedXai, where I developed a forex forecasting platform using tools from topological data analysis.
